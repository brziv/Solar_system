    const texture = loadedTextures[name] || null;
    const material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ 
        map: texture,
        color: texture ? 0xffffff : data.color
    });
    
    const planet = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    
    // Apply orbital inclination

    // Elliptical orbit calculation
    const eccentricity = userData.eccentricity || 0;
    const semiMajorAxis = userData.originalDistance;
    const r = (semiMajorAxis * (1 - eccentricity * eccentricity)) / 
              (1 + eccentricity * Math.cos(userData.angle));
    
    // Position calculation
    const x = r * Math.cos(userData.angle);
